# Automacao-com-Python

**This project was developed at IntensivÃ£o de Python carried out by [*Hashtag ProgamaÃ§Ã£o*](https://www.youtube.com/@HashtagProgramacao). The idea of â€‹â€‹this project was to show how we can automate repetitive tasks using Python. We also saw how to use the pyautogui library to help us with this or other automations;**

**ðŸ’» Project Topics:**
- Understanding the problem;
  - We have an extensive database with the products provided by our company, our task is to create a Python code to automate the registration of each product on the company's website;
- Getting to know the libraries;
  - Our main library is [**Pyautogui**](https://pyautogui.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), this is the library that will allow you to control the mouse and keyboard to perform automations on your computer using Python.
  - We also use the [**Pandas**](https://pandas.pydata.org/) library, is a data analysis and manipulation tool.
  - Finally, we use the [**Time**](https://docs.python.org/3/library/time.html) library, we use the Sleep function to slow down the code so that there are no compilation errors.
